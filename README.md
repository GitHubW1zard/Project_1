Planetary Simulation with Turtle Graphics

This Python script simulates a simple planetary system using the Turtle graphics library. The script displays several celestial bodies orbiting around a central "sun" object.

Features:
Sun: A central object representing the sun, depicted as a large yellow circle.
Planets: Several planets orbiting around the sun, each represented by a smaller circle. The planets included in the simulation are Earth, Mercury, Venus, and Mars.
Moons: Earth has one moon, Mars has two moons.
Stars: Randomly scattered stars are displayed around the sun to enhance the visual appeal.
Orbital Motion: All celestial bodies move in circular orbits around the sun, creating a dynamic simulation.

Format:
The simulation window size is set to 1500x1500 pixels with a black background.
The planets' sizes, colors, and distances from the sun are defined within their class.
The simulation runs indefinitely, displaying the continuous motion of the celestial bodies.

Modifying the Simulation:
You can adjust the parameters of the planets (radius, color, size) and stars (number, radius range) to customize the simulation.
To add more planets or moons, create instances of the Planet class with appropriate parameters.
